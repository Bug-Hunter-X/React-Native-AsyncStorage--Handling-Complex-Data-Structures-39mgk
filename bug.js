In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, a common issue is encountering unexpected behavior or errors when dealing with complex data structures like objects or arrays.  AsyncStorage only stores strings. Attempting to directly store objects can lead to unexpected behavior, data loss, or even crashes.  The problem often manifests as incorrect data retrieval, unexpected data types, or silent failures.
